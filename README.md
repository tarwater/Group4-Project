NOTE: Line 16 in ProductManagementServlet has to be updated to hold the path to the products.txt file. This easiest way to find this is the right-click products.txt in Netbeans and look at the properties.

Adding, editing, and deleting products now works perfectly.

To do: Add input validation for adding products,
Make it look a little prettier,
Get the User registration/login working
